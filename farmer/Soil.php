            <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Clay Soil is a heavy soil type that benefits from high nutrients. Clay soils remain wet and cold in winter and dry out in summer.
                These soils are made of over 25 percent clay, and because of the spaces found between clay particles, clay soils hold a high amount of water.
                Because these soils drain slowly and take longer to warm up in summer, combined with drying out and cracking in summer, they can often test gardeners.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Sandy Soil is light, warm, dry and tends to be acidic and low in nutrients. Sandy soils are often known as light soils due to their high proportion of sand and little clay (clay weighs more than sand).
                These soils have quick water drainage and are easy to work with. They are quicker to warm up in spring than clay soils but tend to dry out in summer and suffer from low nutrients that are washed away by rain.
                The addition of organic matter can help give plants an additional boost of nutrients by improving the nutrient and water holding capacity of the soil.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Loam soil is a mixture of sand, silt and clay that are combined to avoid the negative effects of each type.
                These soils are fertile, easy to work with and provide good drainage. Depending on their predominant composition they can be either sandy or clay loam.
                As the soils are a perfect balance of soil particles, they are considered to be a gardeners best friend, but still benefit from topping up with additional organic matter.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Silt Soil is a light and moisture retentive soil type with a high fertility rating.
                As silt soils compromise of medium sized particles they are well drained and hold moisture well.
                As the particles are fine, they can be easily compacted and are prone to washing away with rain.
                By adding organic matter, the silt particles can be bound into more stable clumps.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Peat soil is high in organic matter and retains a large amount of moisture.
                This type of soil is very rarely found in a garden and often imported into a garden to provide an optimum soil base for planting.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Chalk soil can be either light or heavy but always highly alkaline due to the calcium carbonate (lime) within its structure.
                As these soils are alkaline they will not support the growth of ericaceous plants that require acidic soils to grow.
                If a chalky soil shows signs of visible white lumps then they can’t be acidified and gardeners should be resigned to only choose plants that prefer an alkaline soil.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Also known as the “omnibus group”.
                It covers about 18.5 % of the total land area of the country.
                It is found in regions of low rainfall (eastern and southern parts of the Deccan Plateau). Along the piedmont zone of the Western Ghats, a long stretch of area is occupied by red loamy soil. This soil is also present in parts of Odisha and Chattisgarh and in the southern parts of the Middle Ganga Plain.
                The red colour is due to the presence of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks. The soil appears yellow when it is in hydrated form.
                The fine-grained red and yellow soil is usually fertile while the coarse-grained soil is less fertile.</p>

                Black soil is also known as “Regur Soil” or the “Black Cotton Soil”.
                It covers about 15% of the total land area of the country.
                It covers most of the Deccan Plateau – parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Tamil Nadu. In the upper reaches of the Godavari and Krishna, and the north-western part of the Deccan Plateau, the black soil is very deep.
                The colour of these soils varies from deep black to grey.</p>

                Also known as arid soil, it accounts for over 4.42 % of the total land area of the country.
                The colour ranges from red to brown.
                Desert soils are sandy to gravelly in texture, have low moisture content and low water-retaining capacity.
                These soils are saline in nature and in certain regions, the salt content is so high that common salt is obtained by evaporating water.
