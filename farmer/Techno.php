            demand for farm automation, digitalization, and sustainability. Emerging agriculture trends mark a shift
            towards smart farming and efficient utilization of time and resources while reducing crop losses. Smart
            farming is an upcoming trend that deploys technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), computer vision,
            and artificial intelligence (AI) for farming. Robots and drones are accelerating farm automation by
            replacing manual farm operations such as picking fruits, killing weeds, or water spraying.

        <p class=" text-lg m-5 ">Further, AgriTech startups develop IoT devices, powered by sensor technology, to
            collect real-time field data. This allows farmers to make data-driven decisions. Additionally, the
            widespread adoption of precision agriculture and indoor farming in recent years fuels IoT growth in farming.
            Taken together, these AgriTech trends generate disruptive and sustainable changes in agricultural practices.
            The focus is to not only improve the overall quality and quantity of crops and enhance livestock management
            but also to reach the ultimate goal of a sustainable future.</p>

                        Agriculture</span>4CLIMATE is an Indian startup that develops AER 360, a connected climate
                    monitor for indoor farms. It measures and tracks temperature, humidity, vapor pressure deficit, and
                    dew point to provide farmers with real-time data on their growing environments.

                    The device integrates with other automation systems and features a dashboard that allows farmers to
                    access live and historical farm data. This way, the company allows CEA businesses, growers, and
                    agronomists to ensure optimal conditions to maximize plant growth.
